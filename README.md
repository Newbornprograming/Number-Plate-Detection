# NumberPlateDetection

This project was created using Python with OpenCV to detect the number plates and EasyOCR to read the plates

Setup
Install OpenCV pip install open-cv python

Install CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA (Optional)
CUDA Toolkit functions to process EasyOCR in reading text derived from images using the GPU. This can make processes run faster than using the CPU

Install Pytorch
An Example when already have CUDA Toolkit
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

Installing without CUDA :
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio 

Install EasyOCR (https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)
